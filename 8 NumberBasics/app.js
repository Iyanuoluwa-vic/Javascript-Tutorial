// numbers are lossly typed in javascript it doesnt declare the type of the number it just stores it as a number
// when creating number we do not put quotes around it because it is a number

// not like java where you have to declare the type of the number
const number = 10;
let number2 = 20.3;
let number3 = 20.3;
number2 = "it is loosely typed";

const add = number + number3;

console.log(number);
console.log(number2);

console.log(add);
